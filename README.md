This is repository for my CS 236 project: NeRFBusters in the Stanford Wild.
The goal of the project was to apply the NeRFBusters method to Stanford datasets (namely, Hoover Tower) that were more "in-the-wild" in nature, i.e., there were less constraints in how the images were captured.
As such, this repository is forked from the NeRFBusters repository.
Changes were made for debugging purposes and to incorporate the Stanford datasets into the experiments.
